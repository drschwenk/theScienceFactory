I'm a software engineer who delights in finding things out with data. 

I'm a Seattleite who is part researcher, part design geek, and an engineer to the core. 
I previously devoted some time to academic physics before transitioning to the world of high-performance computing and simulation. 
This blog is a place to play with including Ipython and interactive D3 in statically generated website.
