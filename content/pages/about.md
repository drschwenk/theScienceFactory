Slug: about

I'm a software engineer who delights in finding things out with data. 

I'm a Seattleite who is part researcher, part design geek, and an engineer to the core. I previously devoted some time to academic physics before transitioning to the world of high-performance computing and simulation. I'm currently spending some time in another pupal stage at [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/) as I make the transtion to data science.
