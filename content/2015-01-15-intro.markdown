Summary: Getting the first post out of the way

I'll be using this space to talk about personal projects, data science, machine learning, python, and any pebbles smoother or shells prettier than ordinary that I find. The next few weeks will focus on my time at the [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/) data science bootcamp in New York, but the focus should broaden as I return to the civilian world.
